Damath is an educational board game that is commonly played throughout the Philippines. It is also used as a competitive game for all levels of education with different variations. This paper uses the AlphaZero framework to train a model of the Vision Transformer with Jumbo CLS token architecture and the C++ front-end of PyTorch to learn how to play integer Damath through self-play. The model was able to develop its own strategies without prior human knowledge of the game except for the rules of Damath. The researchers were able to produce five different versions of the best model for twenty iterations over 2.5 days on the cloud with a computer that has 515673MiB of RAM, an AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3975WX CPU with 32 cores at 3.5000 GHz clock speed, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU on an Ubuntu 25.04 Linux Virtual Machine. The fifth and final version of the model beats all of the previous versions of the model and was also able to beat an expert Damath player for three out of ten games. However, the model exhibits strong-early game but weak middle-to-late game competence which is due to the short training time and computatational resources.
